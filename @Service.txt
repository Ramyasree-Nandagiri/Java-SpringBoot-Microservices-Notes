@Service is used for the business logic.

common business logic is written 


Business logic we write in the service  to  maintain re-usability.


In controller we call the methods in the service.
We use dependency Injection in the controller and call that service methods.

@PathVariable,@RequestBody  we dont write in service.
In service we write exception handling code and logic


For put we have to pass the entire request body.
