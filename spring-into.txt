JDBC---

we are going to perform some data base operations

servlets and JSP  are developed and we can develop web based applications


5 standarad steps for JDBC---

1.JDBC is depending on the database, if the database is changed we have to write again 

Transactions are important for interview .
Transaction management are important .

ORM--object relational mapping
---------------------
it will take care of data base operation, we have to write only java program.

Every table in database is represented in ORM. object.


ORM is of 
JPA,
Hibernate

Struts web Framework
--------------------------


Eg: Nokia
nokia have Microsoft org tie up.

Spring is application framework supports all types applicaitons
struts will support  web application framework.


Spring is developed in AI also.
Spring will develop a meaningful application, 

If we just know the core java , we can develop the spring based application.



when we work on servlets and JSP we follow MVC pattern.

Spring Boot
--------------------

difference between spring and spring boot



Microservice is a architecture
-------------------------------
It is not a technology,

Spring Boot will have embedded server and auto configuration
Spring people introduced spring boot on the top of spring
Spring boot acts as a wrapper on the top of the spring.


Spring vs Spring Boot
-----------------------------

1. spring is used to develop web application and MVC  type Application.

2. IOC container and dependency Injection are the features of Spring.

3. External server is used to deploy the application.

EG:Tomcat 

Spring Boot
------------------

1.Spring Boot we use REST api.

2.Auto Configuration is the primary feature of spring boot application.

3.Spring boot itself consists of embedded server, we can also have an external server also when we use spring boot

4.No need of external server in spring boot

5.Using spring boot we can develop Microservices kind of application eg: REST API.


can we develop a microservices using spring ? only spring boot is used to develop microservices.?


java will run on java servers like tomcat

jdk for developer purpose.

 1st module in spring is core module.
 core module
--------------------

easy to text,
----------------------------




@Controller
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAutoConfiguration



IOC---if we write a prgm , we need object, so inorder to covert the object , it specifies the sources for that object.



service oriented

1.bean
2.Applicaiton Context


Dependency Injection
---------------------------
1.
Arpita call agindi


Inversion of Control
----------------------
