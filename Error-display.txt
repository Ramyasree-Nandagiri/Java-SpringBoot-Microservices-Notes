To display errors in response like postman we have to set some properties in the application.properties.
so if we set those properties only the errors will be displayed in the postman .

If we dont set those error properties in the application.properties, we dont get those errors messages in the postman. we get errors in the console.
To display errors in the postman ,like custom errors we have mention the below two properties in the application.properties file.



application.properties
-----------------------
we have to use 


server.error.include-message=always
server.error.include-exception=true
