@Repository
---------------------------

The @Repository annotation is used to interact with different databases, such as NoSQL databases and relational databases. 

Also, when a Java class is marked with @Repository annotation, Spring Boot automatically creates and adds the required context.


@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    User findByUsername(String username);
}


@Repository is used when ever we create a dummy package repository and add the details.

com.examaple.repository is the package we have created.

and inside the package we have added the java class called myRespostiry class
