First we have to use spring initializer to get all the files and dependencies for the spring project.


First in spring Initializer we have to use Maven project or Gradle project.

We give the project details like project name, package name,

we have two types of packages , jar and war.

java version is choosen and we can generate a project.


Spring-Initializer  will give us the following files

1.pom.xml.
2. src folder
3.Go Into the src folder and  we have resources folder.

Spring initializer is used to create a boot applications

Finially we create on generate button and download that zip file

We have to go to sts software and open that folder, we have to extract that folder
That is the project we have created in spring initializer.


In sts 

we have to go to file --->import ----> existing maven projects----> browse the folder which is created using spring-initializer--->click on pom.xml ->click on finish.


In STS we have  spring boot framework .

The main starting point of our application is application.java.

In resources folder we have application.properties file.

we also have test file for testing the application we do unit testing Application.Tests.java
