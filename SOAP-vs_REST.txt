To develop distributed applications we use either SOAP or REST

Two systems communicate with each other with different  of their programming language is called Interop ability.

java system should be able to communicate with .net system

both cant communicate inorder to communicate with each other, they convert the java application or object to XML and send to .net application.
This .net application will read that XML file .

Converting a java object to XML file is called Marshelling
Converting from XML file to java object is called unmarshelling.

Interopability can be achieved using XML.

 
SOAP is a protocol

REST is a architecture based.

Most of the distributed applications are developed using REST protocol as REST is easy to implement and SOAP is protocol based architecture.
Distributed applications are developed using webservices.


SOAP is difficult to implement

REST will never ask to data format, how to present the data will be in developer data
return the data in string format he can
return the data in json format he can 
return the data in XML format he can
The developer can return or send the data in any type of data how we architect the data that is in developer hand.
so REST is architecture based.
