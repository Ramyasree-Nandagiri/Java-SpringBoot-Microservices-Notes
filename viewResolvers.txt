spring framework provides a way with the help of which you can work with the views.


viewResolver is an interface in spring framework.

For working with views in Spring boot we use viewResolver.

Just like jsp in java , in spring boot we use viewResovler.

viewResolver maps the view name to the corresponding view.

There are various View Resolvers available in Spring, such as InternalResourceViewResolver, XmlViewResolver, etc.


ViewResolver provides a mapping between view names and actual views. View addresses the preparation of data before handing over to a specific view technology.


InternalResourceViewResolver is also the default view resolver of DispatcherServlet class, which acts as the front controller in the Spring MVC framework

As controller will update the model and call respective view, this view resolver is helped in getting a path where views are located.
